### **About this app.**
#### My personal goal with this app was to get a better grasp of C# principles and what they are. In most cases I tried to break up or 'tag' in comments whatever method or class was demonstrating polymorphism at work.\

### **About this app.**
#### My version of the New York Times WORDLE game that you normally can only play once per day. This app was meant to test Data Binding and sending to XAML from code like initializing columns in a grid. Then the game has a hidden word that you guess by typing in 5 letter words to give you hints through color coding about what the possible hidden word you **need** to type may be. Trying to get letters the player types to show in each letter box is pretty challenging given how basic it is as a feature.



## APP3 | Terminology quiz app showcasing data collection.

### **About this app.**
#### This is a trivia game. It is meant to play similarly to The Impossible Quiz game. The app demonstrates object oriented princples like abstraction and polymorphism and containment. This was a way for me to test external data. By sending files with specific conditions. Some files are meant to only display certain images if certain conditions are met, like a trivia question be put on screen and a hidden answer. So it is kind of like the Wordle Game. getting the Player to type in a answer and have a method run to check if the answer was correct is one of the main goals when creating this app.
